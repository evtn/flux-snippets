# flux-snippets

Since `flux-lang/algorithms` was created, this repo would serve for some really basic samples.

A repo for flux code snippets, created to discuss language features and show some concepts

Disclaimer: a lot of stuff on `flux` is under consideration. 
It is encouraged to discuss everything (if it's not stated otherwise in this readme or anywhere else)
